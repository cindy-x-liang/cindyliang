                    <p style="color:white;font-size: 18px">I am a sophomore studying computer science at Cornell
                        University.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        My initial interest in computer science began when I worked in a biomedical AI lab.
                        There, I helped develop an Android application that utilizes simple gesture recognition to help
                        the communication of those who have speech and motor disabilities such as Cerebral Palsy.
                        Although I initially joined the lab due to my biomedical interests, I was in awe by the power
                        computer science had to provide individuals with the ability to speak.
                        Inspired to learn more, I am now a computer science major at Cornell involved
                        in several on-campus project teams
                        to further my interest in computer science.

                        <br>
                        I am an active member of Cornell AppDev where I am
                        a backend developer for the app Volume.
                        Volume is an
                        app that showcases all student-created content ranging from articles to magazines. Volume also
                        displays
                        student organization events and information.
                        <br><br>
                        I am also a member of Cornell University Unmanned Air Systems, a project team that builds an
                        unmanned aircraft. I am part of the Intelligent Systems subteam, which is the group that focuses
                        on machine learning and algorithm development for the aircraft.

                            Every recruitment cycle, GCC will receive roughly 100 applicants who submit applications
                            through a Google form. To prepare for deliberations, the recruitment team will have to
                            manually copy and paste all the applicant data into a PowerPoint for easy viewing.

                            assign them to categories based on cuisine type, preparation time, and meal type.

                            The Path Planning project was completed with the project team CUAir at Cornell.
                            <br>
                            The purpose of the project was to help guide the aircraft to complete its 'airdrop' task.
                            The plane must fly to 2 designated target locations to drop a water bottle and stay within
                            competition boundaries in order to successfully complete this task.
                            <br>
                            For this project, I used Python to help develop an algorithm for how the plane would reach
                            the target locations. This algorithm would choose waypoints that the plane would fly to that
                            ensured the plane would stay within boundaries and reach the correct location.

                            Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) disease is a neurodegenerative disease that affects all
                            nerve cells in the body. Currently, there is no cure for ALS disease and the progression of
                            ALS eventually leads to death.
                            <br>
                            This project utilizes past patient records and recognizes patterns in symptom onset in order
                            to allow for early diagnosis of ALS disease. Early diagnosis allows for the possibility of
                            prevention measures to be placed that can mitigate symptoms and even halt the development of
                            ALS disease. Data mining algoirthm is used for pattern recognition in symptom onset. This
                            project was completed with Princeton Pharametch.

                            From 2020 - 2021, I was an high school student researcher in Dr. Mark Albert's Biomedical
                            Artificial Intelligence lab. Dr. Albert published a book titled Bridging Human Intelligence
                            and Artificial Intelligence and I co-authored one of the chapters.
                            <br>
                            The chapter I wrote is titled "Early Visual Processing: A Computational Approach to
                            Understanding Primary Visual Cortex". In this chapter, I highlight the similarity between
                            early visual processing in the human brain in the primary visual cortex and Gabor wavelet
                            codes. More about this chapter can be read in the above hyperlink.
